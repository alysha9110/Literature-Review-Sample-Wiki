## The Challenge

Traditional research reports, however excellent, often become digital paperweights. Important insights get buried in lengthy PDFs that few people actually navigate or reference.

## My Solution

I took Koi Tū's comprehensive education policy report and rebuilt it as an interactive wiki with:

- **Visual navigation**: Revolving slideshow of key charts and findings
- **Intuitive structure**: Clickable subject index that actually helps you find what you need
- **Living document approach**: Easy to update, cross-reference, and bi-directional links

## What This Demonstrates

- **Information architecture**: How to structure complex research for actual usability
- **User experience thinking**: Designing for engagement, not just information dump
- **Technical execution**: Hand-coded using TiddlyWiki to ensure every interaction serves a purpose

## Why I Built This

Good research deserves to be used, not just published. This wiki shows how thoughtful presentation can make valuable insights accessible to busy decision-makers who need information quickly.

It's the kind of knowledge management system I'd want to use myself—and that's always the best test.
